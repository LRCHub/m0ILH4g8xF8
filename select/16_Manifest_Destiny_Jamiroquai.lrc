[00:39.50] 'Cause I remember
[00:41.53] It was four hundred years or more
[00:46.51] Since you came to crucify
[00:51.71] And they were taken far away from home
[01:10.71] 
[00:57.18] There were promises of paradise
[01:01.90] But if they had been told that day
[01:04.65] That they would be sold this way
[01:08.15] To satisfy the souls of chosen men
[01:25.15] 
[01:12.25] See I had to look carefully
[01:15.45] At the shame of my ancestry
[01:18.58] To redefine the story line again
[01:34.58] 
[01:22.52] Hey, if I was taken for a day and shown another way
[01:29.32] Now every child can learn a different thing
[01:34.43] See I tried a million times but I had to change my mind
[01:39.98] Oh, sadness was the best thing I can bring
[02:00.98] 
[01:44.23] On the inside he was dead and this is what he said
[01:50.20] As he took away the bloom above the clouds
[01:55.02] Oh, superiority was clearly meant to be
[02:01.03] So destiny will manifest in time
[02:17.03] 
[02:05.88] So where has love all gone?
[02:11.07] A troubled trail of tears will tell the take
[02:16.05] Of how I was put down where I don't belong
[02:21.79] Woman, child and man for sale
[02:36.29] 
[02:26.83] For ethical slavery is just an absurdity
[02:32.48] How can you be alive when you are dead?
[02:37.36] With these chains of hypocrisy, the shame of my ancestry
[02:42.66] Forever stained by blood in which you tread
[03:04.16] 
[02:47.73] Hey, if I was taken for a day and shown another way
[02:52.65] Oh, now every child can learn a different thing
[02:57.24] See I tried a million times but I had to change my mind
[03:03.60] Oh, sadness was the best thing I can bring
[03:24.60] 
[03:08.76] On the inside he was dead, oh, and this is what he said
[03:14.27] As he took away the bloom above the clouds
[03:18.61] Oh, superiority was clearly meant to be
[03:24.48] So destiny will manifest in time
[03:40.48] 
[03:30.35] So where has the love all gone
[03:35.31] So wanna know where, wanna know where
[03:38.13] Wanna know where, wanna know where
[03:43.21] Somebody tell me where the love has all gone
