[00:46.43] I lie awake, I've gone to ground
[00:52.16] I'm watchin' porn in my hotel dressing gown
[00:58.95] Now I dream of you but I still believe
[01:05.59] There's only enough for one in this lonely hotel suite
[01:32.59] 
[01:14.22] The journey's long and it feels so bad
[01:21.16] I'm thinkin' back to the last day we had
[01:27.77] Old moon fades into the new
[01:31.05] And soon I know I'll be back with you
[01:33.86] I'm nearly with you, I'm nearly with you
[01:53.86] 
[01:41.90] When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
[01:47.67] And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
[01:54.53] And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
[02:01.50] Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny
[02:30.50] 
[02:23.68] On a clear day, I'll fly home to you
[02:29.36] I'm bendin' time, I'm gettin' back to you
[02:37.02] Old moon fades into the new
[02:40.60] And soon I know I'll be back with you
[02:43.25] I'm nearly with you, I'm nearly with you
[03:03.25] 
[02:51.81] When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
[02:57.07] And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
[03:04.01] And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
[03:11.06] Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny, yeah
[03:43.06] 
[03:19.58] When I'm weak, I draw strength from you
[03:25.19] And when you're lost, I know how to change your mood
[03:31.97] And when I'm down, you breathe life over me
[03:38.80] Even though we're miles apart, we are each other's destiny
[04:07.80] 
[04:35.83] I'll fly, I'll fly home
[04:48.41] I'll fly home and I'll fly home
